## wanna add a scoring system to this first

-need to add function so score wont keep adding infinitely

-change questions?

now I want to add loops to change variable and iterate throughout them

worry about HTML and CSS styling at end it just wastes time and is inefficient doing it in between

<!-- fun stuff -->
<!-- keyboard presses -->
<!-- local storage -->
<!-- add sound??? -->
<!-- add animations??? -->

Anything blocking your progress?
HTML and CSS isnt my specialty
Getting a good UI together
extra code in the way is slowing me down - clean this up!!!

shouldn't append until on click

<!-- container.append(newQuestion); -->

for going to next question - add new button?
that clears the innerHTML and adds new question

Daily Standup Common Pitfalls & What Not to Do

#1: Misalignment
#2: Too Lengthy
#3: Problem-Solving During The Standup
#4: Inconvenient Meeting Time
#5: Standups Can Make Introverted Folks Uncomfortable
#6: Not Listening to Teammates
#7: Skipping Standups
#8: Not Raising Blockers

<!-- ideas -->

check for unintended behavior?

<!-- save for end -->

add a timer?
implement sound?
animation?

<!-- ideas  -->

make a seperate iteration setting the action the null and clearing the HTML out that you do not want

prob have to redo event listeners as well

the way youre iterating isnt working

maybe put the for loop in the initial button and loop off of the question list that would make the most sense to me

maybe create a next button to iterate???
