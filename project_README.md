Need to add questions and answers.
-after a certain amount of questions are wrong the game would be over for the player
a good UI, for players to have good experiences
-ability to restart midgame
-new question adder (or option to pass on a current question being asked)

do everything in the console to start - need to utilize DOM manipulation
