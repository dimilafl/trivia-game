Project Description

My app is called

My Random Question Game.

This a game app for people who want to play test their trivia knowledge in different types of subjects.
(start with one subject and add more later)

One player can play, and test their breadth of knowledge by challenging themselves against the games scoring system.
(add/subtract 1 point per question, after a certain amount of pts change difficulty lvl?)

The score would be kept automatically, and game results should be displayed at then end of a round

If they get a certain amount wrong the game will end with a final score displayed.

Users will have the option to play again.

In the future, I would want to add a feature where a player can play against other users, and have a high score tracker. I would also want to add animations and color changes to make the UI more interesting
